        <h2>Early beginnings (1990â€“1993)</h2>
        <p>The very first web browser was created by Tim Berners-Lee in 1990, called <strong>WorldWideWeb</strong> (later renamed Nexus).
           Nexus served as both a browser and a basic editor. Early browsers that followed were often text-only and limited in features.</p>

        <h2>Mosaic and the graphical web (1993)</h2>
        <p>Mosaic, released in 1993, introduced graphical rendering for text and images and made the web accessible to non-technical users.
           Its GUI-based approach helped popularize the World Wide Web.</p>

        <h2>Netscape, Internet Explorer, and the browser wars (mid-1990s)</h2>
        <p>Netscape Navigator (1994) gained rapid popularity and dominated the 1990s. Microsoft entered the market with Internet Explorer (1995),
           bundling it with Windows, a move that significantly reduced Netscape's market share and led to antitrust litigation.</p>

        <h2>Open source and diversification (2000s)</h2>
        <p>Developers of Netscape founded the Mozilla Foundation and launched Firefox (2004), an open-source browser emphasizing privacy and
           customization. Apple released Safari (2003), a browser tailored for Apple platforms. Opera remained an experimental browser
           supporting many device types.</p>

        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>The early era of browsers established important trends: graphical rendering, support for multimedia, and competition that pushed rapid innovation.
           These developments set the stage for modern browsers that focus on speed, standards compliance, and richer web APIs.</p>
